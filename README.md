# Pong In Taylor

Pong made in the [Taylor framework](https://github.com/HellRok/Taylor).
It features an AI that's, not so good being honest but its fun even so.
The motivation behind this project was to get my feet wet with taylor
and ruby for game development.

# Play it

You can get the latest release from [here](https://github.com/Chadowo/pong-taylor/releases)

# Development

First clone the source code:
`git clone https://github.com/Chadowo/pong-taylor.git`

and [download](https://taylor.oequacki.com/#downloads) Taylor for your
platform, once that's done you should move the taylor executable to the
directory where the source code is. With that it should be as easy as
running the executable!

This project uses [Rubocop](https://github.com/rubocop/rubocop) for
linting, you can install it with the following command:
`bundle install`
